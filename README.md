Control your iRobot Braava M6 through HomeKit. (Available for the 800 and 900 series with V2.0 or higher)

# Installation

## 1. Installation
```bash
npm install -g homebridge-braava-m6
```

## 2. Confirm the IP address to which Braava M6 is connected with the official application.
- 2-1. Open the `iRobot HOME App`.
- 2-2. Select  More ➔  Settings ➔ Wi-Fi Settings ➔ Details of robot's Wi-Fi
- 2-3. Check IP Address items. (example: 192.168.xx.xx)

## 3. Get password and blid.
- 3-1. Move to the directory where you installed your node modules.  
     (example path `/ust/local/lib/node_modules`)
- 3-2. Go in the `dorita980` directory
- 3-2. run `npm run getpassword <Braava M6 IP address>`
- 3-3. Follow the displayed message.
```
Make sure your robot is on the Home Base and powered on (green lights on).
Then press and hold the HOME button on your robot until it plays a series of tones (about 2 seconds).
Release the button and your robot will flash WIFI light.
Then press any key here...
```

This process often fails.
Please check the following points and try several times.

- Is the environment installing Rumba and homebridge connected to the same wifi?
- Is Rumba in the Dock and in a charged state?
- Please try running "npm run getpassword 192.16.xx.xx" after the sound has sounded after pressing the home button of the room for 2 seconds
- Please check the version of Node.js. I confirmed that it works with "v7.7.1", "v8.9.0" or "v9.1.0".

If successful, the following message will be displayed.
Please check "blid" and "Password" of displayed message.

Robot Data:
{ ver: '2',
  hostname: 'Braava M6-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
  robotname: 'Your Braava M6’s Name',
  ip: '192.168.xx.xx',
  mac: 'xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx',
  sw: 'vx.x.x-x',
  sku: 'R98----',
  nc: 0,
  proto: 'mqtt',
  blid: '0123456789abcdef' }
Password=> :1:2345678910:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP <= Yes, all this string.
```

blid is `0123456789abcdef`.
password is `:1:2345678910:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP`.

## 4. Update homebridge configuration file.
```json
  {
    "platform": "Braava M6",
    "name": "Braava M6",
    "robots": [
      {
        "name": "Name of the robot in the Home app",
        "blid":"123456789abcdefg",
        "password": ":1:2345678901:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP",
        "address": "192.168.x.xx"
      }
    ]
  }
